# Chernobyl Zone - DayZ

## About
This project is a port of the original [Chernobyl Zone](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=692082939) map by [ArmanIII](https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArmanIII) for Arma 3, based on the publicly available source code.

> **Note**
> Terrain is still in an unfinished state with many issues and I don't have any plans to continue the development, so feel free to use the source files to your needs.

## Structure
- Project structure is prepared for packing with [Mikero Tools](https://mikero.bytex.digital/Downloads). 
- Terrain configuration files were split to a separate game archive to optimize the packing efficiency and located in `./ChernobylZone_c/`.
